**Enhancing Glacial Lake Outburst Flood Prediction in High Mountain Asia Region with Ensemble Learning**

The present study aims to assess the recurrence of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs)
in the High Mountain Asia (HMA) region, which has attracted significant attention due to
its abundance of glacial lakes compared to other regions. Researchers widely acknowledge
GLOFs as the most prominent hazard associated with the cryosphere. Unlike previous
studies that have focused on individual events or had limited geographical scope, the present
study stands out for its comprehensive inventory of GLOFs in HMA. This inventory, which
includes detailed data on event timing, lake formation, drainage processes, and downstream
impacts, serves as a solid foundation for using machine learning (ML) models and ensemble
techniques to assess the recurrence of these outbursts. Utilizing the dataset documenting
697 individual GLOFs occurring between 1833 and 2022, ML techniques are applied to
analyze patterns and predict the likelihood of future GLOF events by leveraging algorithms
to discern underlying trends and factors contributing to GLOF recurrence.
